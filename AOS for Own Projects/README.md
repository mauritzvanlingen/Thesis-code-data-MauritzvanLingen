# Thesis code B,Sc, thesis Mauritz van Lingen (u791472)

This is the code and data produced by myself for this thesis.

The AOS software and F0 dataset used for this thesis can be found on (https://github.com/JKU-ICG/AOS). the C++ implementation of the LFR algorithm has been used to compute the integral images used fot his thesis. 

in the DET folder, the YOLO v3 implementation of the CNN used for object detection of the contrast (un)adjusted TAOS images that were generated using the LFR algorithm and F0 dataset.

## Results thesis

- contains the 19 TAOS (un)adjusted for contrast images
- the imgage and detections folder contains the contrast (un)adjusted TAOS images with detection boxed made by the YOLO v3 CNN.
